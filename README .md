 VANILA SOUFFLE
What is a Soufflé ?

A soufflé is a baked dish with a flavorful base mixed with beaten egg whites. When baked, air bubbles in the egg whites expand, puffing the soufflé up over the top of the dish. The name for this signature French dish is a derivative of the French verb “souffler,” which means “to blow” or “to inflate.”
